How did the NFL passing game evolve over those years provided?
Which teams showed patterns I could analyze over those 20 years?
What can the findings I get from that show about how the game will continue to evolve?
What percentage of plays were passes in 2023 compared to 2001?
11/3 work
How to expand on question on line 5
I would get python to import all the passing game statistics over the past 20 years and then I'll evaluate the differences over time that come from the statistics
I could also bring it down to a team level by having python seperate the stats by teams at a certain point
